## Greedy algorithm and Minimum spanning tree

Abstract graph problem (network design problem) Minimize cost of building transmission lines Desired set of edges is a tree (no cycles) Clustering data points by proximity. Approximate solution for salesperson problem. (approximation algorithm)

### General approach

-   Start with empty edge set T
-   Keep adding edges to T
-   Till all the points is connected

### Greedy Principle

Always pick the best edge under current circumstances.

### Prim’s Algorithm

Similar to Dijkstra’s Algorithm pick the edge of minimum weight that will connect a vertex in T and another vertex that is not in T. Prof of correctness: Claim: After any number of edges are chosen, algorithm’s current edge set T is a subset of some minimum spanning tree for G. (Hence, once T spans all of G, T is itself an MST for G.) Pf: by induction on # of edges chosen so far. Base: before any edges are chosen, T is empty, so is a subset of every MST for G. Ind: Suppose Prim’s criterion picks a next edge e. Let C and N be the connected and unconnected vertices of G after picking edge set T. By IH, T is a subset of some MST T\* for G. Some edge e’ of T\* connects C and N, as does edge e. If e != e’, the T\* U{e} (spanning tree + 1 edge) forms a cycle in G. Hence T’ = T\* U {e} -{e’} is another spanning tree for G. Prim’s criterion picked e instead of e’, so w(e) <= w(e’). Conclude that W(T’) = W(T\*) – w(e’) + w(e) ≤ W(T\*), and so T’ is a minimum spanning tree that contains T U {e}, as claimed. QED Implement Prim’s algorithm

```pseudocode
starting vertex gets v.conn = 0, all other u get u.conn = ∞
mark all vertices as unconnected
while (any vertex unconnected)
    v <- unconnected vertex with smallest v.conn
    for each edge (v, u)
        if (w(v, u) < u.conn)
            u.conn = w(v, u)
    mark v connected // augment partial MST with edge from T to v
```

Algorithm runs in time Θ((|V| + |E|) log |V|) using a binary heap

### Kruskal’s algorithm

Union find data structure Kruskal’s criterion: add to T the edge e of minimum w(e) that does not form a cycle when combined with edges already in T. Heap, or pre sorted list (no update needed) Connected components detection Union-Find algorithm Running time of Kruskal's Algorithm

-   Stages: sort edges, run main loop
-   Main loop: add next-smallest edge provided it does not create cycle
    -   Equivalently: add next-smallest edge provided its endpoints aren't in same connected component, i.e. their components are disjoint
    -   Need disjoint-component data structure
-   Union-Find: check disjointness in O(log |V|) time
-   Main loop running time: O(|E| log |V|) <-- we can cut off after we

add |V|-1 edges Total cost: O(|E|log|E| + |E|log|V|) = O(|E|log |V|)

-   Last equality holds b/c E = O(|V|2) and log(|V|2) = 2 log |V|
-   Same as Prim's since |E| = Ω(|V|) or else MST wouldn't exist
