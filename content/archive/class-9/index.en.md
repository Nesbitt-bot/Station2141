## How to Balance a tree

Worst cost preview Bridge From Previous Lecture AVL Tree - Heights of left, right subtrees of every node differ in height by at most 1 Balance factor height of left subtree - height of right subtree (empty node has height -1) every node of an AVL tree has a balance factor of either -1, 0, +1 Insertion node into an AVL tree can make the root's balance +2 or -2. Resulting tree may no longer be AVL tree

### Restore balance

Rotate tree Rotate right at parent x, putting left child of x as parent. X Y / \\ / \\ Y T3 <=> T1 X /\\ /\\ T1 T2 T2 T3

```pseudocode
rotate_right(node x) -> node:
	node y=x.left
	x.left=y.right
	y.right=x
	return y

rotate_left(node y) ->node:
	node x=y.right
	y.right=x.left
	x.left=y
	return x
```

```java
public class Node{
    private Node left;
    private Node right;
    private Object value;
}

public void rotateRight(Node x){
    Node y=x.left;
    //Node T1=y.left;
    Node T2=y.right;
    //Node T3=x.right;
    x.left=T2;
    //x.right=T3;
   	y.right=x;
    //y.left=T1;
}
public void rotateLeft(Node y){
    Node x=y.right;
    y.right=x.left;
    x.left= y;
}
```

### Types of unbalance

left left higher - rotate right on root left right higher - rotate left on root left (back to case left left higher) - rotate right on root right left higher - rotate right on root right (back to case right right higher) - rotate left on root right right higher - rotate left on root

### When rebalance

insertion only rebalance once deletions check up to the root

## Alternative Non Binary Tree

### B tree

height of root to leaf is constant.

### 2,3,4 tree

h 2^(h+1)-1 keys when insert promote first, then split can be map to binary tree

### Red and Black tree

x -> x xy -> y / x xyz -> y / \\ x z lose balanced with factor two, better performance for more insertion and deletion. AVL would be better when searching intensive.
