## Efficient collections via hashing

Outline:

-   Dictionary ADT
-   Hashing
    -   Goal: avoid collisions while preserving correctness.
    -   Front end: hash value design for objects
        -   for new application code
    -   Back end: hash table design as a data structure.
        -   from library

Hash Function Pipeline Objects -> Integers -> Buckets (key) (integers) (indices)

### Dictionary

insert() insert a key value pair find() based on keys return key value pair remove() based on keys remove key value pair

#### some bad implementations

Let U be the set of all possible keys Allocate an array of size U If we get a record with key k, put it in k's array cell.

problem for direct table:

-   U>>n
-   key aren't integers

Idea: Hash Functions A hash function h maps keys k of some type to integers h(k) in a fixed range \[0,N) Collision, when two key mapped to one value Simple strategy: chaining

hash table

n/m+1<f(n)<n

n/m+1<f(n)<n

n/m+1<f(n)<n

m(buckets)+n

Simple Uniform Hashing load factor = n/m m can be adjust dynamically.

### Controlling the Load Factor (in chaining, not linear probing)

constant load factor = constant complexities hash DOS(Denial of Service) attack

### Some Hash function design

#### Assumptions

Objects to be hashed have been converted to integer hash codes range from \[0,N) For java, &0x7fffffff (java hash code can be negative)

#### Two Main Approaches

##### Division hashing

bucket index = hashcode modulo table size. the perils of division hashing: if j = c mod m, them j mod d = c mod d prime number! avoid pow of 2 and 10

##### Multiplicative hashing

let A be a real number in \[0,1) b(c) = floor(((c\*A)mod 1.0)m) x mod 1.0 mean fractional part of x. cA mod 1.0 is in \[0,1), so b(c) is an integer in \[0,m) - an index. A should not be too small. suggest picking A from \[0.5,1) Ex: A=(sqrt(5)-1)/2

#### Hashcode generation
