M11 Lab will be out. pre-lab longer than usual~ May not be hard as AVL~

## Weighted Shortest Paths

### Weighted Graph

assume w(e)>=0 Dijkstra's Algorithm... Can convert edge weight to placeholder nodes, then BFS as unweighted graph. Only work for integers, and expensive...

### Shortest Path

Alternative strategy -- "Relaxation"? Explore, when found a better weight, v.dist + w(v,u) < u.dist update u.dist, and continue~ **Dijkstra: at each step, explore edges out of vertex v with smallest v.dist, and relax all its adjacent vertices..**

```pseudocode
// mark all vertex unfinished and set start point distance to 0.
while (any vertex unfinished)
	v <- unfinished vertex
	for each edge of v
		// Relaxation~
		if v.dist + edge < u.dist
			u.dist = v.dist + edge
	mark v as finished.
```

Then you get the shortest path tree starting form v! Proof of correctness of Dijkstra's algorithm: **(when edge weight is not negative)** **Claim**: when we explore the edges out of vertex v, v has its correct shortest-path distance D(start,v) stored in current best estimate v.dist. **Pf**: by induction on order of exploration. **Base**: starting vertex is explored first, with its correct shortest-path distance of 0. **Ind**: suppose the algorithm is about to choose v for exploration. Assume that v.dist > D(start, v) (i.e. v's distance if wrong). Consider a shortest path from start to v. start -> u -> v Let u be last finished By IH, u had its correct shortest-path distance when it was explored. Moreover, D(start, u) <= D(start,v), since u precedes v on shortest path to v. If edge u -> v is on shortest path, then exploring u's outgoing edges assigns v its correct shortest-path distance D(start,v). -><- Otherwise, some other vertex x lies between u and v on this path, with D(start,x) <= D(start,v). start -> u -> x ->v Since v does not have its correct shortest-path distance, v.dist > x.dist, and so x would be explored next, not v -><-

#### Track Distances of unfinished vertices.

Use Priority Queue, keyed on dist. Dijkstra's algorithm with priority queue:

```pseudocode
v.dist <- 0; H[v] <- PQ.insert(start vertex v)
for all other vertices u:
	u.dist <- inf; H[u] <- PQ.insert(u)
	
while(PQ not empty)
	V <- PQ.extractMin()
	for each edge (v, u)
		if(v.dist + w(v, u) < u.dist)
			u.dist <- v.dist + w(v, u)
			H[u].updatePriority(u.dist)
```

#### Running time of Dijkstra's Algorithm

For each vertex, we do one PQ insert() and one PQ extractMin() For each edge, we don one PQ updatePriority() Total cost is |V|(T insert+ T extractMin)+|E| T update priority operations for PQ is all \\Theta( log|V|) Hence, algorithm runs in time \\Theta (|V|+|E|) log |V|) Bellman-Ford algorithm (For negative weights) \\Theta(|V||E|) Floyd-Warshall Algorithm (For all shortest path of vertices) \\Theta(|V|^3)
