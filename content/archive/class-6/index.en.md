## Lecture 6

How fast can we sort?

### Outline

Sorting overview Lower bound on running time of comparison-based sorting Radix sort Bound radix sorting

#### What do we know about soring?

Worst case n log n algorithm

-   HeapSort
    -   Call extractMin() (log n) for n times.
-   MergeSort
    -   Divide and conquer algorithm.

Other sorting

-   BubbleSort - n^2
-   InsertionSort - n^2
-   ShellSort - n^3/2 or n^2
-   QuickSort - n log n

Sound of sort

#### How fast can we sort?

what operations can be considered as constant time?

-   All the sorting algorithms we listed work on any **Comparable** data type.
-   Can answer "is x > y" in constant time.

pair wise comparison -> comparison sort measure times of comparison. for fastest algorithm O(n log n). Is there a function f(n) where the fastest sorting algorithm have Omega(f(n))

#### A Trivial Lower Bound

at least n/2 comparison needs to be made. Omega(n/2) at least. use tree to encode logic of comparison sequence. Every decision tree corresponds to a sorting algorithm... Running time of tree is path from root to leaf. eg. for comparing 3 elements, height of tree=3. suppose every decision tree has t(n) leaves, the tree have branching factor of w, then the problem requires at least log\_w t(n) to solve. Apply to comparison sorting: w=2 t(n)=n! (reason: n\*(n-1)\*(n-2)\*(n-3)\* .... \* 1) depth of decision tree for comparison based sorting >= log\_2 (n!) log (n!)=Theta(n log n) prof: log (n!)=O(n log n) log (n!)=Omega(n log n) **It is impossible to sort in comparison**

#### Breaking the n log n barrier

Counting sort (given k)

-   Linear to n sorting algorithm.
-   Extend with integer keys

Radix sort (given k)

-   Divide each input integer into d digits
-   Digits may be in any base k
-   Sort using d successive passed of counting sort.
-   We sort by **least significant** digit first.
-   Sort in each pass mush be **stable** - never inverts order of two inputs with the same key.
-   total time = Theta(log\_k n\*(n+k))
